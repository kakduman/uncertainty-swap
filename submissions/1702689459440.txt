"[Discussion] How do you deal with uncertainties during university life prior to graduation?"

"You figured out how to live in a foreign country. You figured out how to get the grades to get into university. Then you figured out how to graduate from university. You are the person that did those things. If nothing else, you have proven that you can figure stuff out. Have confidence in that."

The specifics may not apply to everyone, but "you can figure stuff out" does. Whether it's actually necessary to figure stuff out rather than being comfortable with our uncertainty? That's a different question.
