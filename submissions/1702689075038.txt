Trust that you can handle anything life gives you. Some of the hardest breakups really gave me the best gift. I discovered my independence. I used the pain to fuel my drive to be better. I focused on my health, my art, my education and discovered I loved being alone. Accept that uncertainty is part of life. We've got to flow with it.
