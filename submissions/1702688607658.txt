If you think about it, in the present moment, we have no worries, we have no problems. All of these "problems" that we create are simply in our head, in the future (which does not exist). I deal with it by taking it one day at a time. I don't know what life is gonna look like for me 2 years from now, but I do know what to expect for today. Then I think, "okay what shall I accomplish today?", so I'll go on to do my homework, my chores, catch up with friends and family, so on.

If you're occupied with the right stuff you might notice that you won't even have time for these thoughts, because your focus is on the present. Oh, if you're struggling on what to do even in the present moment, it might be a case of not really knowing who you're and what you want.

But also, worrying about your past and future is completely normal. I don't know what your overthinking is exactly about, but I'd say, give them an outlet! At times, I feel like there's so much noise in my head... so I'll write down what I'm feeling and let the emotions flow. I'm not the type of person who'll routinely journal, but once in a while is very helpful.
