Check out "The Power Of Now" by Eckhart Tolle. It will change your life.

Uncertainty is natural, but it is the fear of it that causes suffering. This type of fear - which exists without any true, immediate danger - is all in the mind.

We as a species have become so used to using thinking & emotions that we have become dependant upon them. We have become identified with the activity of our minds and have lost sight of the fact that the mind is our tool, not a way of life.

I struggle every day to not get lost in the looping trains of though and emotion; they are activities that are conditioned from a lifetime of relative input (experiences, traumas, etc). It takes time to recondition your relationship with the mind. And you must experience the dysfunctional relationship before you can become aware of the relationship, and therefore transcend that relationship.

As the mind arises with thought, and emotion in tow, see it. It is not your enemy. See it & accept it without reaction or response. And return to the present moment.

The only moment that exists is now. The past & future are just thoughts. Thoughts beget more thoughts and emotions. Just simply being will feel unusual at first, but with practice it gets easier and you can feel the anxiety and such fade.

Being "in the flow" of the present moment, as I call it, is a way of life that allows you to access information that the mind can never simulate or anticipate: Intuition. Your gut/heart/intuition has information that your mind cannot comprehend, and can only be accessed as you are living things in the Now. So live them, and let the mind rest until it's logical tools are needed in moderation.
