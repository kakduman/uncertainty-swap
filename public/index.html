        <h1>Uncertainty Swap: An Interactive Exhibit</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Uncertainty Swap, an interactive exhibit where people can
            share and swap experiences of uncertainty. This project is a journey 
            into the complexities of decision-making in a world brimming with 
            choices. Uncertainty is an exploration of indecision, magnified 
            by the myriad of options presented by technology, pre-populated with
            personal anecdotes, family and friend's stories, and online forum posts.
            Uncertainty Swap is a space to share your
            own remarks on uncertainty, and in return, gain insight from many 
            universally shared uncertain experiences.</p>
